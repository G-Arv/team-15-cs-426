Project Name: HerHealthHub

Team Name: Team 15

## Overview of Application
HerHealthHub is an application whose mission is to mitigate gender bias in healthcare. Our approach utilizes a combination of features to ensure women receive proper care when visiting their providers and maintain their health. These features include a records scanner to keep track of any medical records the user decides to upload, a ratings section to evaluate providers as well as give suggestions for fellow users, an online journal to track symptoms, and reminders to take medications throughout the day. We aim to release a mobile and web application which will include all features listed.
